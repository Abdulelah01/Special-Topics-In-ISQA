### My Name Is Abdulelah Almubarak 
_Here we go_
* For the first file there are some data missing which will cause error in the final report "No empty cells".
* There are columns that are indicated by a letter which lose some of the information that is needed to communicate the right information.
* The zoo file we see some of the data is colored which will cause confusion if anyone needs to use them in the future, they won't be able to understand it.
* Multiple tables that cause confusion also we have graphs that are showing some part of the information. 
* The consistency of the data on column Z is not as it should be where we have 0.5 and 50 that shows a difference in the scale of measure and as it was mentioned in the data organization spreedsheet.pdf file 
* The dates on the files are set as DD-MM-YYYY and its supposed to be as prepared in my schedule below 
* The names on the columns and things somewhat vague where they don't identify what is needed also the proper way of naming the columns is improper. 
* The file zoo-temp they used data dictionary that should help with identifying some of the names however the its they used calculation which will case the data in the file to be corrupted.
* The use of the data validation to avoid error specifically explains that the data entered must be consistence where it should show the whole numbers in one column and the decimal numbers should be in the same range.
* For empty cells we can use Not available to avoid having inconsistent data
